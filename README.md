# charcount

what? it counts char frequency recursively in all files `.go`.

why? it would be nice to know such thing when you want to decide which keyboard layout to pick (in pretty damn seriously way ðŸ¤£).

go? yeah, `golang` is my language now. but it's not that difficult to make a regex filter to match whatever file you want. you got the power.
